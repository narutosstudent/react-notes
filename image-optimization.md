# Introduction

In this post, we'll dive into the fundamentals of image optimization.

This involves understanding the different types of image formats, how to choose the right format for your images, and how to optimize them for the web.

# Fundamentals of Image Optimization

Image optimizations revolves around two key aspects: file size reduction and appropriate image format selection.

## File Size Reduction

- Compressing images to reduce their file size without compromising quality.
- Techniques include lossy and lossless compression. "Lossy" compression reduces file size by discarding some data, while "lossless" compression reduces file size without losing any data. "losseless" compression is preferred for images that require high quality, such as photographs.
- Tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, and Squoosh can help reduce image file sizes.

## Appropriate Image Format Selection

- Choosing the right image format based on the type of image and its intended use.
- JPEG for complex images with many colors, because it supports millions of colors and is great for photographs.
- PNG for simpler images with fewer colors, because it supports transparency and lossless compression.
- WebP and AVIF are modern formats that offer better compression than JPEG and PNG, but may not be supported by all browsers.

# Why Image Optimization Matters

- Images can significantly impact page load speed, especially on mobile devices with slower connections.
- Unoptimized images can lead to much longer load times.
- Faster load times improve user experience and SEO rankings.

It's good to note that a lot of the page load time is spent on images, so optimizing them can have a big impact on your website's performance.

Faster load times improves UX and leads to better conversion rates.
