When building UIs in React, you first break it down into components.

From there you describe the different visual states for each of your components.

Finally, you will connect your components together so that the data flows through them.

- Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy
- Step 2: Build a static version in React
- Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state
- Step 4: Identify where your state should live
- Step 5: Add inverse data flow
