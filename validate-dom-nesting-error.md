# Introduction

The `validateDOMNesting` error in React occurs when the DOM elements are not properly nested according to the [HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).

# Example of how the error looks

The error message will look like this:

```
Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): <p> cannot appear as a descendant of <p>
```

This error tells us that the `<p>` element cannot be a descendant of another `<p>` element.

# HTML specification

HTML has a defined set of rules for how elements can be nested.

Let's look at some examples of correct and incorrect nesting.

Elements must be properly nested and not overlap:

```html
<p>This is <em>very <strong>wrong</em>!</strong></p> <!-- incorrect nesting -->
<p>This is <em>very <strong>correct</strong></em>.</p> <!-- correct nesting -->
```

Other examples would be nesting `<a>` elements inside `<button>` elements, or `<button>` elements inside `<a>` elements. Or them being nested inside each other, such as `<a>` inside `<a>`.

These examples are quite clear why they are incorrect, but why is nesting `<p>` elements inside `<p>` elements not allowed?

# Why is nesting <p> inside <p> not allowed?

The `<p>` element cannot contain nested `<p>` elements or other block-level elements like `<div>`, `<h1>`, etc. This is because a paragraph (`<p>`) is defined as a block-level element that represents a self-contained unit of discourse in the document.

The most important reason is semantic meaning. The `<p>` element is meant to represent a paragraph, which is a distinct section of a document, typically dealing with a particular point or idea. Nesting paragraphs within each other would break this semantic structure and make the document less meaningful and harder to interpret for both humans and machines (like search engines or accessibility tools)
